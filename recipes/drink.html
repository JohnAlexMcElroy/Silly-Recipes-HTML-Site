    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Take the juice from one bottle Secret juice.</li>
      <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V â€” Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those Santraginean fish!</li>
      <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</li>
      <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
      <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
      <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
      <li>Add an olive.</li>
      <li>Drink... but... very carefully...</li>
    </ol>
